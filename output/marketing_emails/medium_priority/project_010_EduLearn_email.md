**Email Body:**

I came across your project posting for Figma Expert for Simple Web App Mockup while researching Ed-tech companies seeking design support.

Your budget range of 30+ hrs/week, 1-3 months suggests you're looking for quality design work, and our subscription model often provides better value than per-project pricing for companies with ongoing needs.

Our design subscription model offers predictable monthly costs, unlimited revisions, and fast turnaround times—perfect for companies needing consistent, high-quality design without the overhead of full-time hires. With a dedicated team familiar with Ed-tech workflows, we can seamlessly integrate with your team.

We're experienced in:
- UI/UX design for web and mobile applications
- Design systems and component libraries
- User flow optimization and wireframing
- High-fidelity prototypes and visual design

Would you be open to a brief call to discuss how we might support your design needs? I'd be happy to share relevant case studies from similar Ed-tech projects.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best regards,
The designsub.studio Team
