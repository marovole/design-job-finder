**Email Body:**

I saw your posting for Staff Product Designer, Mobile and loved what you're building in the Fintech space!

Your budget range of Negotiable (contract) suggests you're looking for quality design work, and our subscription model often provides better value than per-project pricing for companies with ongoing needs.

At designsub.studio, we run a design subscription service that's perfect for startups like yours—unlimited design requests, fast 48-hour delivery, and a flat monthly fee. No surprises, no scope creep, just great design when you need it. We've helped several Fintech startups scale their design without breaking the bank.

We're experienced in:
- UI/UX design for web and mobile applications
- Design systems and component libraries
- User flow optimization and wireframing
- High-fidelity prototypes and visual design

Would love to chat about your vision for Staff Product Designer, Mobile and see if we're a good fit! I'm happy to show you some examples of our recent work.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best regards,
The designsub.studio Team
