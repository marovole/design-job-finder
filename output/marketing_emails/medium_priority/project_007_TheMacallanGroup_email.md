**Email Body:**

I came across your project posting for Senior Figma Web Design Expert while researching Luxury Goods companies seeking design support.

Your budget range of Negotiable suggests you're looking for quality design work, and our subscription model often provides better value than per-project pricing for companies with ongoing needs.

Our design subscription model offers predictable monthly costs, unlimited revisions, and fast turnaround times—perfect for companies needing consistent, high-quality design without the overhead of full-time hires. With a dedicated team familiar with Luxury Goods workflows, we can seamlessly integrate with your team.

We're experienced in:
- UI/UX design for web and mobile applications
- Design systems and component libraries
- User flow optimization and wireframing
- High-fidelity prototypes and visual design

Would you be open to a brief call to discuss how we might support your design needs? I'd be happy to share relevant case studies from similar Luxury Goods projects.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best regards,
The designsub.studio Team
