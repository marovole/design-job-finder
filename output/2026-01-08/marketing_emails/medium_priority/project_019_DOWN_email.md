**Email Body:**

I saw your posting for Mobile UI/UX Designer and loved what you're building in the Social / Dating space!

Your budget range of Negotiable suggests you're looking for quality design work, and our subscription model often provides better value than per-project pricing for companies with ongoing needs.

At designsub.studio, we run a design subscription service that's perfect for startups like yours—unlimited design requests, fast 48-hour delivery, and a flat monthly fee. No surprises, no scope creep, just great design when you need it. We've helped several Social / Dating startups scale their design without breaking the bank.

We're experienced in:
- UI/UX design for web and mobile applications
- Design systems and component libraries
- User flow optimization and wireframing
- High-fidelity prototypes and visual design

Would love to chat about your vision for Mobile UI/UX Designer and see if we're a good fit! I'm happy to show you some examples of our recent work.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best regards,
The designsub.studio Team
