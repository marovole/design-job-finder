### 模板 1: 高预算 SaaS 客户

**Subject**: Re: Your SaaS Platform Redesign - A Scalable Design Approach

Hi [Name],

I came across your UI/UX redesign project on [Platform] for [Product Name]. Your focus on improving user onboarding and dashboard usability really resonates—these are often the make-or-break touchpoints for SaaS products.

Many early-stage SaaS companies we work with face a similar challenge: they need ongoing design support as they iterate quickly, but hiring a full-time designer or working with traditional agencies creates bottlenecks and budget uncertainty.

That's why we built designsub.studio as a design subscription service. Instead of project-by-project pricing, you get unlimited design requests and revisions for a flat monthly fee. For your use case, this means you can tackle the dashboard redesign, then seamlessly move to marketing pages, email templates, or mobile app screens—all without renegotiating scope or budget.

We typically deliver initial concepts within 48 hours and work iteratively until you're 100% satisfied. You can pause or cancel anytime, so there's no long-term commitment.

Would you be open to a quick 15-minute call this week to discuss your roadmap? I'd love to share some relevant SaaS case studies and see if this model might fit your needs.

### 模板 2: 中型企业品牌重塑

**Subject**: Unlimited design for [Company]'s brand evolution

Hello [Name],

I noticed your brand identity project on [Platform]. Creating a cohesive brand system that works across digital and print while staying authentic to your [Industry] roots—that's a significant undertaking.

Many established businesses in your position find that brand projects quickly expand beyond the initial scope: once you have the logo and guidelines, you need business cards, letterheads, social media templates, presentation decks, and website mockups. Traditional project-based pricing can make this expansion costly and unpredictable.

At designsub.studio, we offer a design subscription model that's particularly well-suited for comprehensive brand rollouts. For one fixed monthly fee, you get unlimited design requests across all these touchpoints. Most of our clients use us for 2-3 months during their brand refresh, completing everything they need, then pause the subscription.

The model eliminates budget surprises and allows you to iterate freely until everything is perfect. We maintain brand consistency across all deliverables and can scale up or down as your needs change.

I'd be happy to share how we've helped similar [Industry] companies execute their brand vision. Would you have 20 minutes next week for a brief call?

### 模板 3: 初创公司网站设计

**Subject**: A better way to get your website designed

Hey [Name],

I saw your landing page project on [Platform]—love the concept for [Product/Service]! Building your first product while bootstrapping is exciting (and challenging).

Here's a thought: instead of hiring this out as a one-off project, what if you had a design partner for your entire launch?

designsub.studio works like Netflix, but for design:
→ Pay one monthly fee
→ Request as many designs as you need (landing page, logo, email headers, social graphics, etc.)
→ We keep revising until it's perfect
→ Pause when you don't need us

Most solo founders use us for 1-2 months during their launch crunch, then pause. You get everything you need without burning through your runway on multiple freelancers.

We're pretty fast too—usually 48 hours for first drafts. And since you're iterating based on user feedback anyway, having unlimited revisions is kind of a game-changer.

Want to hop on a quick call to see if this makes sense for your timeline? I'll even throw in some conversion tips for free 😉

Cheers,

### 模板 4: 小企业营销材料

**Subject**: Saw your project on [Platform] - quick idea

Hi [Name],

Your [Project Type] project caught my eye on [Platform]. I love that you're focusing on [specific requirement mentioned].

Quick question: have you considered a design subscription instead of a one-time project?

Here's why I ask—most small businesses we work with start with one project (like you're planning), but then realize they need ongoing design support: social media graphics, email newsletters, sales decks, seasonal promos, etc.

With designsub.studio, you'd get:
✓ Your initial [project type] (like you're already planning)
✓ Plus unlimited additional requests for as long as you subscribe
✓ All for one flat monthly rate
✓ Pause or cancel whenever

It's honestly perfect for businesses that want consistent, professional design but can't justify a full-time hire.

Got 10 minutes this week for a quick chat? I'd love to show you how this could work for [Company].

Best,
[Your Name]

### 模板 5: 创业者个人品牌

**Subject**: Your [Project] idea caught my eye 👀

Hi [Name]!

Just saw your Fiverr request for [Project]—seriously cool idea! The [specific aspect] especially resonated.

So here's a wild idea: what if instead of one logo project, you had a design sidekick for the next few months?

**The pitch**: designsub.studio is basically unlimited design for one monthly price. Think Spotify, but for getting stuff designed.

**How it works**:
🎨 You submit design requests (logo, website, business cards, whatever)
⚡ We turn around drafts in ~48 hours
🔄 Unlimited revisions until you're stoked
⏸️ Pause or cancel anytime

**Why this might work for you**:
Building a personal brand isn't just a logo—it's your website, email signature, social headers, pitch deck, course materials, YouTube thumbnails... the list goes on.

Instead of hiring someone new for each thing (exhausting), you'd have one partner who knows your style and can crank stuff out fast.

Most folks use us for 2-3 months to build everything out, then pause until they need more stuff.

Down to chat about this? Let's jump on a call—I promise to keep it fun and jargon-free.

Let's go! 🚀

### 第二次跟进（1周后）

**Subject**: Final follow-up: [Project Name]

Hi [Name],

I wanted to reach out one last time about your [project].

If the timing isn't right or you've already found a solution, I completely understand. I'll take this as my cue to stop reaching out.

That said, if you'd like to explore design subscription in the future, feel free to ping me anytime. I'd be happy to help.

### "Not Interested" 回复处理

**如果回复说"太贵了"**:

Hi [Name],

Thanks for the quick reply! I totally get it—budget is always a consideration.

One thing worth noting: most clients find the subscription actually saves money compared to hiring multiple freelancers or agencies for different projects. For context, you'd get unlimited design work for less than the cost of most logo design projects.

But if timing or budget isn't right, no worries at all. Feel free to reach out if your situation changes.

Best,
[Your Name]

**如果回复说"我们有内部设计师"**:

Hi [Name],

That's great! Having in-house design talent is invaluable.

Many of our clients actually use us to supplement their internal team—handling overflow work, seasonal campaigns, or specific projects so their designers can focus on core product work.

But sounds like you're all set for now. If your team ever gets stretched thin, we're here!

Best,
[Your Name]

**如果回复说"我们已经找到了人"**:

Hi [Name],

Excellent—glad you found a solution!

If things don't work out or you need backup design support in the future, feel free to reach out.

Best of luck with the project!
